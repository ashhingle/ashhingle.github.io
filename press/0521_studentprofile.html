					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Ashish's research journey and experiences were quite
							different from most. His ability to navigate the system and make do with what he had is
							how he found his interest in technology and the impact it can have. Growing up in a
							resource-scarce country, he mentioned that if something needed to be fixed, there was
							not someone you could take it to; you had to figure out how to fix it on your own. He is
							a self-proclaimed&nbsp;“tinker out of necessity.” Once he discovered the diversity of
							computers and information systems, and how they connect with just about everything
							around us, he never turned back from this passion.&nbsp; </span></p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Ashish Hingle is one of Cal Poly Pomona's international
							students, who transferred from Pasadena City College in 2014. Ashish completed his
							undergraduate degree at CPP in Computer Information Systems and decided to continue his
							education here as a grad student in the College of Business. His ambition has powered
							him to push forward, in what he would soon realize would be an unforeseen road of
							difficulties that challenged him throughout. Nonetheless he describes this experience as
							most rewarding.&nbsp; </span></p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Some of the struggles were part of the migrant experience. He
							was not only challenged by the new environment of the U.S. college system, but in a
							grander view, being in a culture that is significantly different. Being apart from his
							family, in a new country, far away from a home–a home that he has known his whole
							life–was Ashish's biggest obstacle yet. He had to quickly learn how important
							independence and responsibility was for someone in his situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span> But, out of the concrete grew a rose. What bloomed was his
							identity and the person he has become. Ashish said that his migrant story has given him
							many opportunities to do some soul-searching, and it helped him to really figure out who
							he was, what he wanted to do, and where he wanted to grow. Ashish broke through these
							obstacles and began to tackle his new journey. He looked to conquer the mountains in his
							path by &nbsp;concentrating all his efforts towards his academics.&nbsp; </span></p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Saying that Ashish is a very involved student would be an
							understatement. He is currently the Director of Public Relations for the Research
							Scholars Association. As an undergraduate, Ashish was deeply involved with both the
							research and entrepreneurship scene at Cal Poly Pomona. Ashish has been an employee of
							the Office of Undergraduate Research since 2014, growing in different positions within
							the OUR and helping make Cal Poly Pomona a “research for all” campus. He was the first
							employee for the CPP iLab and his designs are still on display throughout the lab. He
							has previously served as the Lead Web Developer for the Collegiate Entrepreneurs
							Organization, Lead Organizer and Advisor for the Bronco Startup Challenge (2017/18),
							Ambassador and Social Media Coordinator for PolyTransfer, and Vice President of
							Communication in the Market Research Club, just to name a few. Additionally, Ashish has
							served the community and volunteered as a judge and mentor for Entrepreneurship Summer
							Camp hosted by Student Innovation Idea Lab, was the Lead Volunteer at the Showcase of
							Excellence, a participant in the Pomona Beautification Day from 2015-2018, and has also
							served as a Lead Planner for the Women in IT Conference. Ashish's significant
							contributions to Cal Poly Pomona, his peers, and surrounding community have been beyond
							phenomenal and has helped make a difference on campus. </span></p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Ashish has also received several scholarships and fellowships
							in his time at Cal Poly Pomona. These include continued support from the Mercer Business
							Scholarship, the Bob &amp; Agnes Suzuki Scholarship, the CIS Leadership Scholarship, and
							the Wagner Fund Scholarship to name a few. Ashish was also named a 2016 President's
							Council Scholar and awarded the Michael and Eileen Considine award through the College
							of Business Administration. </span></p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Ashish has been a part of several successful research
							projects since his start at Cal Poly Pomona. He says that he owes his early exposure to
							research to Dr. Sonya Zhang, who has been his research mentor and someone Ashish has
							looked up to for many years. Dr. Zhang's "never give up" mentality has helped Ashish
							power through many of the obstacles that research projects naturally have. Although he
							has been in the research realm for a while, Ashish still experiences difficulties that
							were similar to when he first got involved with research. He explained that part of it
							was because there was a slight disconnect between trying to conduct research in a
							college that has traditionally been industry driven. &nbsp;It can be difficult to
							sustain and nurture independent research in such an environment. Nevertheless, Ashish
							continues to push through and envision all the possibilities about how his projects can
							benefit him, which motivates him to keep going.&nbsp; </span></p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Ashish explained that his most recent research projects are
							focused on student self-efficacy in high-impact practices in higher education,
							technology, and entrepreneurship, in addition to emerging technologies in information
							systems. He aims to understand factors that enhance student success rates. His first
							project is a mixed-methods assessment of entrepreneurial capabilities, using a pre- and
							post-survey, of students who participate in the Student Innovation Idea Lab. Ashish
							assisted in creating the survey instrument to identify student success by collecting
							data on participating students' perceived abilities. This is an ongoing project and has
							been presented at the 2019 European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship in
							Kalamata, Greece. The second project looks at the impact of undergraduate research on
							student success at a public, Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).&nbsp;The final project
							looks at the technology acceptance model and how likely students are to accept
							institutionalized food delivery applications. </span></p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Ashish emphasized that his successes happened because he had
							great support from his faculty members. He said, “The availability of experienced and
							willing faculty has been a vital tool in growing my research projects. Faculty members
							are vital in creating a thriving culture through accessible and visible mentorship and
							this is what has been true for all my mentors.” </span></p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Ashish will be graduating with his Master of Science in
							Business Administration (MSBA) in spring 2020 and will be joining a doctoral program in
							fall 2020. Ashish hopes to continue to broaden his research skills, acquire new
							knowledge and educate others as well.&nbsp; Ultimately, he is striving to work in either
							an industry or academic high-tech field. Ashish, without a doubt, will continue to do
							great things in academia, research, his field, and in the communities around him.&nbsp;
						</span></p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Ashish stated, “My research in some ways is about my journey
							and the journey of others just like me.” </span></p>
					<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span>Advice for student researchers</span></h4>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>&nbsp;“You are never too early or too late to start a
							research project. When I first heard of being involved in research at CPP, it sounded as
							though it was a 1-2-year process that you end in your senior year. Learning through
							research, and the skills you build doing this task, is something that does not end in
							your senior year. It starts a path that I expect to be on for many more years to come. I
							think you should look at this with the same lens.” </span></p>
					<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span>From Ashish's mentor, Dr. Sonya Zhang</span></h4>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Dr. Sonya Zhang is a professor in the Department of Computer
							Information Systems and started working at Cal Poly in 2011. Dr. Zhang believes that
							research is one of the most important concepts to teach students because not only is it
							highly relevant to course subjects, but she believes it also promotes interest,
							confidence in the material, and builds that student-faculty mentorship collaboration. By
							incorporating her research into her classroom, she noticed how well Ashish excelled,
							which is why she did not hesitate to be Ashish's mentor. </span></p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Dr. Zhang shared that Ashish was not only responsible and
							picked up material quickly, but most of all he was enthusiastic about his academics. In
							most cases&nbsp;students learn from their mentor; however, Dr. Zhang said that in this
							case, she learned much more from Ashish. She emphasized that his persistence was
							honorable and very inspiring to her. She has watched Ashish grow from this research
							experience, and more so, grow into a humble graduate student, whose hard work and
							dedication is apparent.&nbsp; </span></p>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span>Dr. Zhang states, “I have no doubt [Ashish] will succeed in
							his upcoming journey as a doctoral student and as a future faculty in higher education.
							I'm glad to have helped him get a good start.” </span></p>
					<h4 style="text-align: left;"><span>To Ashish, from the Office of Undergraduate Research
							Team</span></h4>
					<p style="text-align: left;"><span> Ashish has been an extraordinary model student, and an
							inspiration to all throughout his academic career at Cal Poly Pomona, including to his
							Office of Undergraduate Research (OUR) team. We at the OUR would like to personally
							congratulate and thank Ashish for his years of dedication to himself, our office, and
							our students. His contributions have exceeded all of our expectations, and words cannot
							explain how thankful we are to have had him on our team. Thank you for your hard and
							honest work, selflessness, devoted time, and commitment. We wish you the best of luck in
							your future endeavors, and many successes on your path ahead.&nbsp;</span></p>
