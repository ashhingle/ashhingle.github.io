					<p>In general, communities form around common interests and bring people together. Online
						communities can take many shapes and forms in today's interconnected work. More specifically,
						communities may allow people to interact in social groups, and contribute to shared experiences.
					<p>Developer communities are no different; groups of likeminded individuals come together to learn,
						ask, debug, and build programs and code for a variety of purposes, using a variety of languages.
						These communities exist on sites such as Reddit, StackOverflow, and Google Groups (to name a
						few). Developer and programming communities can have a more macro approach (focusing on what
						good programming looks like, accessibility, and security across programming concepts in
						general), or a micro approach (usually focused on a specific language). In these micro
						communities are interesting nuances:
					<ul>
						<li>Are users often part of multiple communities? What do they talk about in each
							community?</li>
						<li>Are users predominantly asking for technical help?</li>
						<li>Are users talking abstractly about the programming languages?</li>
						<li>Who are the “influencers” in these types of social networks?</li>
					</ul>
					</p>
					<p>For this project, we explored the interactions between different programming communities on one
						particular platform: Reddit. We wanted to learn more about the micro communities, and what they
						can tell us about developer and programming online communities. We also wanted to determine
						influencers and topics of interests in selected subreddits and find similarities between
						selected subreddits. To that end, our research questions were:
					<ol>
						<li>
							Which subreddits have common users, who do they interact with, and who are important users
							in the network?
						</li>
						<li>
							What kind of posts (questions, news, etc.) do users post on each subreddit?
						</li>
					</ol>

					<p>Next, we preprocessed the data by removing any records that were missing or incomplete, such as
						removing “deleted”
						authors, and splitting the records into datasheets with edges and nodes to be able to do network
						analyses.</p>
					<p>We focused on aggregated analysis vs. temporal analysis for the project. The initial batch of
						languages we selected was
						based on languages we found in syllabi at George Mason University, but in general these
						languages were picked randomly
						for interest. We also made sure to include languages on the spectrum of newness and maturity. We
						selected the most
						active subreddit for each language, and excluded “dead” languages (i.e., Algol, APL).</p>

					We initially wanted to see what else we could learn about our users mainly through centrality
					measures and PageRank. We spent some time identifying each community within our map and labeled them
					as such. If you remember from the table we showed earlier, Python and JavaScript subreddits account
					for a large number of interactions between users.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you notice within each community, there are concentric circles moving outwards from the center.
					Users in the center interact with that subreddit often, and those on the outside do so less. Those
					right on the edge of the circle often only have 1 post/comment (extremely low engagement).

					<p>We realized the importance that the sizes each subreddit played in the conversation. The number
						of posts and subs differ between the subreddits. The table above shows the number of
						subscribers, comments per day, total posts within the date range of our dataset and the number
						of users who cross-posted to another subreddit. JavaScript was by far the largest, and Cobol the
						smallest in terms of subscribers. Additionally, based on the 3rd column, we can see that users
						posted more
						in Python everyday on average than all the other subreddits.</p>
					<p>From the network analysis we conducted, Python also had the largest number of posts, and cross
						posts. After having established that there were users that were cross posting across subreddits,
						our next step was to figure out what the top cross-posted subreddits were for each user within a
						subreddit.</p>
					<p>One of our hypotheses was about cross-posting between subreddits based on the nature of the
						language. For example, HTML and JavaScript are often used together for front-end web-design, so
						it would make sense that there would be shared users here.</p>
					<p>However, what we discovered was that Python seems to be the strongest link between all the
						subreddits, having a high PageRank score on our graph, and also the largest amount users
						bridging junctions between their specific subreddit and the python subreddit.</p>

					<p>We found some interesting data to back up the claim of Python's predominance. The table on the

						Programming, which is the first row, users cross-posted most to python, JavaScript, and finally
						java.</p>
					<p>The users in 8 of our 14 subreddits cross-posted most to Python. In fact, Python was ranked
						within the top 3 of every subreddit we analyzed. This is interesting and our hypothesis based on
						reviewing our data for this is kind how ubiquitous Python has become with programming today. It
						is taught in schools, bootcamps, self-learning courses, has a relatively simpler learning curve
						compared to other languages, is used in industry and interfaces well with other languages.</p>
					<p>On closer analysis, we found that much of the discussion in more mature language subreddits such
						as Cobol, Fortran, and lisp involved troubleshooting how to get Python functionalities to
						interface with their legacy code/hardware, in addition to language migration queries.</p>

					<p>We calculated several centrality measures for the users in the network, including the

						interesting profiles. Overall, they interact with users often helping with ways to get the users
						code working correctly, and being able to provide additional resources that would otherwise not
						have been available to the users. Some of these top influencers also link to other content on
						other sites, so they are marginally aware of cross posting across sites here too.</p>
					<p>We found 1 user with an extremely high score for betweenness, and page rank, and a high measure
						for closeness, and the largest degree of all our users. This user as it turned out, was actually
						a bot known as <em>AutoModerator</em>, that is often used by subreddits as a management tool.
						The intention of spreading shared community guidelines, and rules across multiple communities
						seems to work, and if we need to spread a contagion type of message across all 14 subreddits,
						this user would be our pick.</p>
