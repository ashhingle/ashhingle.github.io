norman1,Norman,Who do you think is responsible for the Boeing Disaster?,I believe the responsibility for the Boeing Disaster falls on Boeing as a company because they did not spend adequate time in making sure the pilots were correctly trained. They allowed bureaucracy to be the main reason for the fault.
norman2,Norman,What do you think about the culture at Boeing in response to the disaster?,Boeing did not show the best they had to offer in response to the disaster. They went on a year long blame spree trying to find a different organization to blame and overall this is not a productive way to get work done. I am unsure of they will ever recover from these incidents and the way it has tarnished their reputation.
norman3,Norman,What was the reason the accident happened?,"Boeing created a situation where the pilots were not being trained properly, and new technological features were being rushed into production."
norman4,Norman,How can we ensure future safety and transparency and rebuild trust?,By moving away from the business and stock focused mindset that got Boeing into this mess to begin with. Boeing has always attracted the best and the brightest engineers and scientists. So why are we muddling their creativity and innovation with concerns about how competitive they are with Airbus?
meera1,Meera,Who do you think is responsible for the Boeing Disaster?,"I don't think I have enough information to make that judgement. I believe that the FAA should step in as they are responsible for Aviation Security and as such, should lead the investigation."
meera2,Meera,What do you think about the culture at Boeing in response to the disaster?,"Overall, the mixture of business and engineering has been a trend we have noticed in academic research related to these large aviation organizations. I am unsure what to make of this trend, but it seems to be detrimental. "
meera3,Meera,What was the reason the accident happened?,"The accident was a unfortunate mixture of problems across various domains. There were mechanical issues, leadership issues, and the overall oversight mechanism seemed to fall through for this particular case."
meera4,Meera,How can we ensure future safety and transparency and rebuild trust?,Being open with people and showing how things will change going forward. There is clearly an institutional issue or power structure issue. Boeing needs to be able to hold its employees accountable in order to build back trust from people in general.
andrew1,Andrew,Who do you think is responsible for the Boeing Disaster?,"Boeing, and the FAA are both equally responsible for this catastrophe. Boeing, because of the leadership issues subverting good engineering, and the FAA for not doing their job."
andrew2,Andrew,What do you think about the culture at Boeing in response to the disaster?,The culture at Boeing seems to be overall concerning. This catastrophe could have been avoided if there wasn’t such a reliance on technology to immediately solve every issue.
andrew3,Andrew,What was the reason the accident happened?,"Through my perspective as a software engineer, I believe it's necessary to put the software updates through various different simulations and scenarios. Boeing had mentioned that they have done some testing, but they had kept it hidden from their pilots If they were to run different scenarios and stuff like that to make sure like in case like even like the minor rare occurrences are happening so that pilots would even know how to fix those solutions in case those care like rare occurrences actually were to happen, that if they run those simulations multiple times to make sure that everyone knows how to fix it or if the software itself is doing well it could by running simulations, they could notice any problems with the software."
andrew4,Andrew,How can we ensure future safety and transparency and rebuild trust?,"I think we do need the pilots to be trained better but with the complexities of aircraft design as they are now and the software that goes with them or just have to be just as complex, there needs to be a lot more time allotted for designers and engineers to make these planes as safe as possible because there's so many different teams in so many different people putting in there and for putting in their effort to make sure that the plane is safe. So there needs to be tight like no pressure from outside sources to make sure that these that the plane itself could be the best that could be."
john1,John,Who do you think is responsible for the Boeing Disaster?,The complexity of the situation was the problem at the end of the day. These devices are getting so complicated and pilots can only be able to do so much with their attention and time in a specific context.
john2,John,What do you think about the culture at Boeing in response to the disaster?,"Having worked at the FAA, I can vouch for the tenacity and valor of all the Boeing staff. I have worked with many people and the culture of the company is based on innovation, as it has been for many years."
john3,John,What was the reason the accident happened?,The MCAS system was over correcting for an issue that shouldn't really have been designed. There should clearly be some limitations to what's expected of the pilots that are flying these planes.
john4,John,How can we ensure future safety and transparency and rebuild trust?,"I agree that pilot need to be trained more that we should have had more transparency but I'm worried that there's so much complexity. And then you said that, how much training can be pilot gap and how big will our training manual look like if we keep adding things to it. So I think we have to somehow figure out how to do this better within the complexity there is already there in the system."
mary1,Mary,Who do you think is responsible for the Boeing Disaster?,"I don't think there is anyone to blame for the issue. It is a rather unfortunate event and we would rather prioritize the conversation to focus on how we can solve this, rather than pointing fingers."
mary2,Mary,What do you think about the culture at Boeing in response to the disaster?,"We have received numerous awards on how innovative and forward thinking Boeing is as a company. While there are always some that doubt that a company has the best interest for the public, Boeing has shown time and again that we genuinely do."
mary3,Mary,What was the reason the accident happened?,I think that people can see that we've been a safe company. It just started we had only one problem with Boeing Max's 737 planes. It's an unfortunate event that happened within the last like two events that happened in the last six months. But I think that people should be able to still maybe trust us if we released a new plane or something like that because we just been… One of the top companies in the aircraft industry
mary4,Mary,How can we ensure future safety and transparency and rebuild trust?,"I think that we should just a train pilots, a little bit better. Um, I mean, safety is a big problem. But if our pilots would have had the knowledge of how to maybe override the MCAS system. Then this all could have been prevented with one just simple maybe just a little bit more training. I just don't think we have the money right now."
sarah1,Sarah,Who do you think is responsible for the Boeing Disaster?,"Boing, the FAA, and all the parties involved are to be blamed for this catastrophe. Ultimately many lost their lives and their families, and friends lives have been changed forever."
sarah2,Sarah,What do you think about the culture at Boeing in response to the disaster?,"The culture at Boeing seems to be toxic to the life of the company. If the engineering folk knew something was wrong, but did not make this known to leadership, then how can they be responsible engineers? If the leadership chose not to do anything, how can they be responsible leaders?"
sarah3,Sarah,What was the reason the accident happened?,I believe the tests that are being used on the simulations are running that needs to be available to the public and pilot training as well that needs to be able to be seen by potential people that are going to be using these aircrafts and people that are going to be flying on them.
sarah4,Sarah,How can we ensure future safety and transparency and rebuild trust?,"By holding those responsible accountable today. As the lawyer representing the families, their pain is immeasurable."
